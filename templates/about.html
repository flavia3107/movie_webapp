        Albania's geographical location shapes the characteristics of its
        tourism economy. The local climate and terrain favor the development of
        a tourism industry throughout the year. In recent years, tourism has
        become one of the most important and growing sectors of the Albanian
        economy and is considered by the government as one of the main engines
        of national growth. Albania is increasingly being recommended as a
        tourist destination by various tour operators and international travel
        guides. World Travel and Tourism Council (www.wttc.org), estimates that
        the direct contribution of tourism to GDP in 2016 was ALL 127.7 billion
        or 8.4% of GDP. The total contribution is estimated at ALL 393 billion
        or 26% of GDP. The tourism sector has generated economic development,
        employment and self-employment opportunities. In terms of employment
        generation, tourism accounted for 7.7% of total national employment in
        2016 with 85,500 jobs. Indirectly, tourism accounts for 23.9% of
        employment in 2016 with 267,000 jobs. The total number of foreign
        visitors has marked a significant increase in recent years, with an
        increase of 80% in 2016 compared to 2011 (total 4.58 million visitors in
        2016 from 2.53 million visitors in 2011). In 2016, there was a 16%
        increase in foreign tourists visiting Albania compared to 2015. Tourism
        revenues in 2016 reached 1.528 billion euros, with a 13% increase
        compared to 2015. Travel and tourism investments in 2016 were ALL 28.9
        billion, of total investment. The country has supported the development
        of tourism in its natural and cultural heritage: UNESCO sites,
        traditional food, beautiful beaches, beaches, rich ecosystems, etc.
        However, the different regions in the country need to work further with
        their unique characteristics to become an intelligently articulated
        destination, in a way that fosters innovation-based productivity and
        efficiency, while preserving its local environment. Tourism has also
        become more diverse over the last few years and is now seen to consist
        of three main product areas: Coastal tourism , where it has been
        developed as the main product that focuses on "beach and sun" tourism.
        The main coastal destinations are Velipoja, Shengjini, Durrës (Adriatic
        Sea), Vlora, Himara, Saranda, Ksamili (Ionian Sea). The product "beach
        and sun" in some regions of Albania, offers advantages in the natural
        environment, accommodation facilities, kitchen services and special
        services. Cultural tourism , although not the main focus, the resources
